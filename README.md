.emacs.d
========

This is my emacs setup.  along with init.el, it's organized into two folders:

* packages/ Small packages that I install by hand
* cmbmacs/ My emacs configuration files, broken down by subject

The packages/ directory currently contains

* guru-mode.el --- Become an Emacs guru (https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode)
* hackernews.el --- Hacker News Client for Emacs (lincoln@comum.org)
* highlight-indentation.el --- Minor modes for highlighting indentation (anton.johansson@gmail.com)
